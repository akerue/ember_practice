# Insight [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/yeoman/insight.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/yeoman/insight)

> Understand how your tool is being used by anonymously reporting usage metrics to [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/)
or [Yandex.Metrica](http://metrica.yandex.com/)


## Access data / generate dashboards

### Google Analytics (GA)

- Use [Embed API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/embed/v1/) to embed charts
- Use [Core Reporting API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v3/) or [Real Time Reporting API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/realtime/v3/) to access raw data, then build custom visualization, e.g. [metrics from Bower](http://bower.io/stats/)
- Use GA's dashboards directly, e.g. metrics from [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io):

## Provider Setup

### Google Analytics (GA)

Currently Insight should to be used with GA set up as web tracking due to use of URLs. Future plan include refactoring to work with GA set up for app-based tracking and the [Measurement Protocol](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/).

For debugging, Insight can track OS version, node version and version of the app that implements Insight. Please set up custom dimensions per below screenshot. This is a temporary solution until Insight is refactored into app-based tracking.

## Collected Data

Insight cares deeply about the security of your user's data, and strives to be fully transparent with what it tracks. All data is sent via HTTPS secure connections. Insight provides API to offer an easy way for users to opt-out at any time.

Below is what Insight is capable of tracking. Individual implementation can choose to not track some items.

- The version of the module that implements Insight
- Module commands (e.g. install / search)
- Name and version of packages involved with command used
- Version of node.js & OS for developer debugging
- A random & absolutely anonymous ID


## Usage

### Google Analytics

```js
var Insight = require('insight');
var pkg = require('./package.json');

var insight = new Insight({
	// Google Analytics tracking code
	trackingCode: 'UA-XXXXXXXX-X',
	packageName: pkg.name,
	packageVersion: pkg.version
});

// ask for permission the first time
if (insight.optOut === undefined) {
	return insight.askPermission();
}

insight.track('foo', 'bar');
// recorded in Analytics as `/foo/bar`
```

### Yandex.Metrica

```js
var Insight = require('insight');
var pkg = require('./package.json');

var insight = new Insight({
	// Yandex.Metrica counter id
	trackingCode: 'XXXXXXXXX'
	trackingProvider: 'yandex',
	packageName: pkg.name,
	packageVersion: pkg.version
});

// ask for permission the first time
if (insight.optOut === undefined) {
	return insight.askPermission();
}

insight.track('foo', 'bar');
// recorded in Yandex.Metrica as `http://<package-
